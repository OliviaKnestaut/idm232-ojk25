Top with half the vinegar; season with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, for at least 10 minutes. Cut off and discard the stem end of the pepper; thinly slice crosswise. (For a milder dish, remove and discard the seeds first.) Thoroughly wash your hands, knife, and cutting board immediately after handling.\n*\nCook the vegetables\n--\nIn a medium pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the quartered mushrooms in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the sliced shallot, chopped bok choy, and as much of the sliced pepper as you\'d like, depending on how spicy you\'d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to a bowl. Stir in the remaining vinegar; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover with aluminum foil. Rinse and wipe out the pan.\n*\nCook the steaks\n--\nIn the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Reserving the marinade, add the marinated steaks. Cook, turning occasionally, 7 to 9 minutes for medium-rare, or until browned and cooked to your desired degree of doneness. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board and let rest for at least 5 minutes.\n*\nMake the sauce & serve your dish\n--\nWhile the steaks rest, to the pan of reserved fond, add the reserved marinade, sugar, and 1/4 cup of water (be careful, as the liquid may splatter). Bring to a boil on medium-high. Cook, stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thickened. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Find the lines of muscle (or grain) on the rested steaks; thinly slice crosswise against the grain. Serve the sliced steaks with the cooked rice and cooked vegetables. Top the steaks with the sauce. Garnish with the marinated radishes (draining before adding).
