# IDM 232: Scripting for Web Design II - Final Project
## https://digmstudents.westphal.drexel.edu/~ojk25/index.php

This recipe database website, Culinary Compass, is the final project for Drexel University's IDM 232: Scripting for Web Design II.
This website was built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL. This project focuses on developing a responsive HTML-based web application that equips students with foundational skills in server-side programming. By creating a functioning prototype, students will learn to handle user input and manage databases. The project will include wireframe designs and a style inventory to guide the development process. By the end of this process, students will have a fully functional recipe site with search features and consolidated code.
